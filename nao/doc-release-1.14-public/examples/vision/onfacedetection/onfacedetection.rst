Reacting to a vision event: face detected
=========================================

:ref:`\<\< return to examples index <example-index>`

This section explains how to implement a module reacted to a complex event
and how to retrieve the information stored in this event.

Principle
---------

This example follows the same principle as here :ref:`cpp-examples-react-bumper`, but is based on
an event generated by ALVideoDevice: FaceDetetected.

This time, the data put into the memory corresponding to the "FaceDetected" key is
more complex than aboolean: it is an ALValue containing information about the
detected face(s).

To retrieve this information, use a proxy to ALMemory, and retrieve the data stored
in the corresponding key.


Example: OnFaceDetection module
-------------------------------

This example follows the same principle as here :ref:`cpp-examples-react-bumper`, but is based on
an event generated by ALVideoDevice: FaceDetetected. This time, the data put
into the memory corresponding to the "FaceDetected" key is more complex than a
boolean: it is an ALValue containing information about the detected face(s).

This example will make NAO say the number of faces it detects.
