<p>This is a particular release for us, many things have changed.
We are in the process of cleaning our whole framework.</p>
<p>We made a clear separation between public and private APIs, we hope that will
help to have cleaner and backward compatible API.</p>
<p>We are in the process of opensourcing the NAOqi framework. This will allow us to
build a better product and to integrate it easily with other robotics framework
like Urbi and ROS. Opensource is coming slowly, in the 1.12 release
you will find the two opensource foundation project: qibuild and libqi-doc.
You will get more in the next release, the goal being to have the whole SDK opensource.</p>

<div class="section" id="volume-controller">
<span id="id1"></span><h3>Volume controller<a class="headerlink" href="#volume-controller" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This version introduces a powerful tool to control and check NAO volume.
No need to go on the robot web page anymore, it can be done
directly from Choregraphe with the volume slider.
This slider is accesible from the right part of the toolbar among all tools
that concern the robot.</p>

<p>The reconnection manager is a new feature that tries to re-establish a connection that has been lost.
The process of reconnection goes with the display of a pop-up to warn the user that the connection
was lost and that Choregraphe will try to reconnect to the robot at the end of the countdown.
The initial value of the countdown is set to 30 seconds.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/choregraphe_reconnection.png" src="../../_images/choregraphe_reconnection.png" style="width: 369px; height: 133px;" />
<p>It is possible to reconnect without waiting the countdown by clicking on <strong>Reconnect</strong>
or to cancel the reconnection process by clicking on <strong>Cancel</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="animation-mode">
<span id="id4"></span><h3>Animation mode<a class="headerlink" href="#animation-mode" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The animation mode is an easier way to animate NAO.
This mode proposes the possibility to activate
and deactivate the stiffness of each part of NAO including the head.</p>
<p>Activation or deactivation can be made by calling each part of the robot as voice commands such as: <strong>left arm, right leg, head</strong> or by touching tactile sensors and pushing bumpers.</p>
<p>The tactile sensor on the middle of the head controls head stiffness.
Left and right bumpers control respectively left and right legs stiffness.
If the robot has hand&#8217;s tactile sensors, stiffness of arms can be controlled by them, if not, it is controlled by the two remaining head&#8217;s tactile sensors.
Leds provide visual indications about which member of NAO has stiffness or not.</p>
<p>In the recording mode, the recording of joints positions can be made by saying <strong>Store positions</strong> or by pressing the chest button.</p>

<p>NAOqi core has been cleanup up. Public APIs have been documented and

<div class="section" id="faster-walk">
<h3>Faster walk<a class="headerlink" href="#faster-walk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This version contains a <strong>faster walk</strong> for NAO. Maximum walk speed has increased
from 9 cm/s up to 14 cm/s, thanks to longer steps (going from 4 cm to 6 cm).</p>
<p>This walk is made possible by an adapted torso elevation, which makes the
walk stable even if the movements are quicker.</p>
<p>This new walk is bit more battery-consuming, and increase NAO&#8217;s motors temperature
quicker, but the walk speed is x 1.5 when NAO walks straight forward (x 1.5 for
lateral movements, and unchanged for backward walk)</p>
</div>

<h3>Custom walk<a class="headerlink" href="#custom-walk" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It is now possible to customize any walk parameters: footsteps height, length,
rotation angle, torso orientation etc. These walk parameters can be set
independently for each leg.</p>
<p>With these parameters, you can design totally custom walks, while still using
trajectory interpolation features. These parameters can be updated on the fly,
giving you even more possibilities.</p>

<div class="section" id="changes-in-destination-control">
<h3>Changes in destination control<a class="headerlink" href="#changes-in-destination-control" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The walk interpolation method has been changed. There used to be a Dubins curve
interpolation for long walk distances, which has been removed to make NAO&#8217;s
moves more predictable.</p>
<p>See <a class="reference internal" href="../../naoqi/motion/control-walk.html#control-walk"><em>Locomotion control</em></a> for more details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="anti-self-collision">
<h3>Anti self-collision<a class="headerlink" href="#anti-self-collision" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>This version introduces a new motion security feature: <strong>anti self-collision</strong>
on NAO&#8217;s arms. The idea is to prevent NAO&#8217;s arms from bumping into the rest of
its body, to prevent possible damage.</p>
<p>The first part is collision detection. To do so, the algorithm uses the current
position of the arms, and a model of NAO&#8217;s body (arms, head, torso etc)
to compute the distance between each element. If at this position, a
collision is possible, the collision avoidance step intervenes.</p>
<p>The collision avoidance step prevents the collision, and finds an alternative
trajectory, that is as near to the desired command as possible. To do so, the
trajectory is computed as an optimization under constraint of non-collision.</p>
<p>For the moment, this feature concerns NAO&#8217;s arms joint commands (joint command
API and Choregraphe). It can be enabled or disabled (it can sometimes prevent
particular movements which are too close from collision).</p>

</div>
<div class="section" id="smart-stiffness">
<h3>Smart stiffness<a class="headerlink" href="#smart-stiffness" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>In the version, you will see the first step of dynamics computation in motion.
We compute every cycle the dynamic model of NAO and deduced for static position
(no joint in movement) the good stiffness to apply for each joint.
As the stiffness is a limitation of torque, we first introduced in NAO a torque control startegy.</p>
<p>The result is a robot more compliant in static position and a lower increase of NAO&#8217;s
motors temperature.</p>

<h2>qiBuild<a class="headerlink" href="#qibuild" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The NAOqi C++ SDK had always come with various CMake scripts to help you build software for NAO.</p>
<p>Previous releases were using a lot of undocumented CMake functions, known as the &#8216;t001chain
Framework&#8217;.</p>
<p>For this release, we decided to rename and document these functions, and this is
how the qiBuild CMake framework was born.</p>
<p>The qiBuild CMake framework helps you write C++ code in a cross-platform way, it makes it
easy to handle dependencies between libraries, to cross-compile, and to support
compiler from gcc to Visual Studio.</p>
<p>It also comes with a set of command line tools, (qibuild configure, qibuild make ...)
which helps you manage several C++ projects with their dependencies.</p>
<p>This is still a work in progress, but in the future this will be the easiest way to build
applications using the NAOqi framework, on the robot, as well as on the desktop.</p>
<p>The whole project will of course be put in open-source license for everyone to contribute.</p>
